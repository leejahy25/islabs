# Task 1: Transfer files between computers
**Question 1**: 
Conduct transfering a single plaintext file between 2 computers, 
Using openssl to implementing measures manually to ensure file integerity and authenticity at sending side, 
then veryfing at receiving side. 

**Answer 1**:
## 1. Set up 2 virtual machines:
- Start Docker Desktop, run cmd as administrator and download `ubuntu` image

```
docker pull ubuntu
```

- Create containers from `ubuntu` image on 2 cmd

```
docker run -it --name vm1 ubuntu
```

```
docker run -it --name vm2 ubuntu
```

The above commands create 2 containers named `vm1` and `vm2`

- Check the containers

```
docker ps
```

## 2. Install necessary packages on virtual machines
Run these commands to install packages

- Check and update packages

```
apt update
```

- Install openssl

```
apt install openssl
```

- Install netcat to conduct transfering

```
apt install netcat-traditional
```

- Necessary package to use `ifconfig` to get ip of the 2 machines

```
apt install net-tools
```

## 3. Generate an HMAC on the Sending Side (vm1)
**On vm1**

- First, create a text file name `plaintext.txt`

```
echo "Transfer files between computers" > plaintext.txt
```

- Generate a secret key

```
openssl rand -hex 32 > secret.key
```

The `secret.key` file will be used by both `vm1` and `vm2` for HMAC generation and verification.

Check the key

```
cat secret.key
```

- Create the HMAC for `plaintext.txt`

```
openssl dgst -sha256 -hmac $(cat secret.key) plaintext.txt > plaintext.txt.hmac
```

This generates an HMAC in the file `plaintext.txt.hmac` for `plaintext.txt`.

## 4. Conduct transfering
- Send the text file, HMAC file and `secret.key` to the Receiving Side (`vm2`) using `netcat`

On `vm1`

```
tar -cf - plaintext.txt plaintext.txt.hmac secret.key | nc -l -p 1234
```

On `vm2`

```
nc 172.17.0.2 1234 | tar -xf -
```

- The `1234` is a port choosen by me

- The `172.17.0.2` is the sender's (`vm1`) ip

## 5. Verify the HMAC on the Receiving Side (vm2)
**On vm2**

- Generate the HMAC for the received `plaintext.txt` using the shared key (`secret.key`)

```
openssl dgst -sha256 -hmac $(cat secret.key) plaintext.txt > received_plaintext.hmac
```

- Compare the HMACs

```
diff plaintext.txt.hmac received_plaintext.hmac
```

![](https://github.com/leejahy25/islabs/blob/ef44e9dc2bf9c51d37a941943aa7cb7cc537c0c6/img/task1_3.jpg)

=> No output => the HMACs match => confirming both integrity and authenticity

# Task 2: Transfering encrypted file and decrypt it with hybrid encryption. 
**Question 1**:
Conduct transfering a file (deliberately choosen by you) between 2 computers. 
The file is symmetrically encrypted/decrypted by exchanging secret key which is encrypted using RSA. 
All steps are made manually with openssl at the terminal of each computer.

**Answer 1**:
## 1. Generate RSA key pair on Receiving Side (vm2)
- On `vm2`, generate the RSA key pair to securely receive the symmetric key:

```
openssl genrsa -out private.pem 2048
```

```
openssl rsa -in private.pem -pubout -out public.pem
```

`private.pem`: RSA private key (kept secret).

`public.pem`: RSA public key (shared with `vm1`).

- Transfer the `public.pem` file from `vm2` to `vm1`.

On `vm2`

```
nc -l -p 1234 < public.pem
```

On `vm1`

```
nc 172.17.0.3 1234 > public.pem
```

## 2. Symmetrically encrypt the file on Sending Side (vm1)
- I will use the same `plaintext.txt` file from Task 1

- Generate a symmetric key:

```
openssl rand -hex 32 > symmetric.key
```

- Encrypt the file with the symmetric key:

```
openssl enc -aes-256-cbc -salt -in plaintext.txt -out plaintext.txt.enc -pass file:symmetric.key
```

`plaintext.txt.enc`: The encrypted file.

- Encrypt the symmetric key with RSA:

```
openssl pkeyutl -encrypt -inkey public.pem -pubin -in symmetric.key -out symmetric.key.enc
```

`symmetric.key.enc`: The symmetric key encrypted with `vm2` public key.

## 3. Transfer encrypted files to vm2
Use `netcat` to transfer the encrypted file and the encrypted symmetric key

On `vm1`

```
tar -cf - plaintext.txt.enc symmetric.key.enc | nc -l -p 5678
```

On `vm2`

```
nc 172.17.0.2 5678 | tar -xf -
```

## 4. Decrypt the files on vm2
Decrypt the symmetric key with RSA using `vm2` private key:

```
openssl rsautl -decrypt -inkey private.pem -in symmetric.key.enc -out symmetric.key
```

Decrypt the file using the decrypted symmetric key:

```
openssl enc -aes-256-cbc -d -in plaintext.txt.enc -out result.txt -pass file:symmetric.key
```

Verify the decrypted file:

```
cat result.txt
```



# Task 3: Firewall configuration
**Question 1**:
From VMs of previous tasks, install iptables and configure one of the 2 VMs as a web and ssh server. Demonstrate your ability to block/unblock http, icmp, ssh requests from the other host.
