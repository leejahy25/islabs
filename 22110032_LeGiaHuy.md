# Task 1: Transfer files between computers
**Question 1**: 
Conduct transfering a single plaintext file between 2 computers, 
Using openssl to implementing measures manually to ensure file integerity and authenticity at sending side, 
then veryfing at receiving side. 

**Answer**:
## 1. Create a text file named `plaintext.txt`:
- Use cmd to write a message and save it in a text file:

```
echo "Transfer files between computers" > plaintext.txt
```

- Verify current folder for newly created file

## 2. Set up 2 virtual machines:
- Start Docker Desktop, run cmd as administrator and download `ubuntu` image

```
docker pull ubuntu
```

- Create containers from `ubuntu` image

```
docker run -it --name vm1 ubuntu
```

```
docker run -it --name vm2 ubuntu
```

The above commands create 2 containers named `vm1` and `vm2`

- Check the containers

```
docker ps
```

## 3. Install openssl on virtual machines
- Run these commands to install packages for openssl

```
apt update
apt install openssl
apt install netcat-traditional
```

- Also, run `ipconfig` to get neccessary information of the 2 machines

## 4. Generate an HMAC on the Sending Side (vm1)
- Generate a secret key

```
openssl rand -hex 32 > secret.key
```

The `secret.key` file will be used by both VM1 and VM2 for HMAC generation and verification.

- Create the HMAC for the plaintext file

```
openssl dgst -sha256 -hmac $(cat secret.key) plaintext.txt > plaintext.txt.hmac
```

This generates an HMAC in the file `plaintext.txt.hmac` for the plaintext file `plaintext.txt`.

## 5. Conduct transfering
- Send both the plaintext file and the HMAC to the receiving side using `netcat`

On vm1

```
tar -cf - plaintext.txt plaintext.txt.hmac | nc -l -p 1234
```

On vm2

```
nc <sender_ip> 1234 | tar -xf -
```

The `1` is the sender's (vm1) ip

# Task 2: Transfering encrypted file and decrypt it with hybrid encryption. 
**Question 1**:
Conduct transfering a file (deliberately choosen by you) between 2 computers. 
The file is symmetrically encrypted/decrypted by exchanging secret key which is encrypted using RSA. 
All steps are made manually with openssl at the terminal of each computer.

**Answer**:


# Task 3: Firewall configuration
**Question 1**:
From VMs of previous tasks, install iptables and configure one of the 2 VMs as a web and ssh server. Demonstrate your ability to block/unblock http, icmp, ssh requests from the other host.

**Answer**:
